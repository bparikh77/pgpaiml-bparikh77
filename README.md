COURSE PROJECTS

Aug ’21

Course: Sequential NLP

Topic: Sentiment Analysis using NLP classifier

Skills and Tools: RNN, word embedding, LSTM, Classification

The project involves building a text classification model which analyses the customer's sentiments based on their reviews in the IMDB database. The model uses a complex deep learning model to build an embedding layer followed by a classification algorithm to analyse the sentiment of the customers.

Course – Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Topic - Implementing an Image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

Skills and Tools - Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Keras, Image Recognition
